        <b>What is Flavor Finder?</b><br>
      </h2>
      <p1> 
          Flavor Finder is more than a cooking application; it's the response of five students who were charged to find a solution to a real problem in their lives. 
          During our first meeting, we sat down trying to come up with ideas. 
          It was when one of our members mentioned that he was cooking during the lecture that we realized how little time most students have to cook. 
          Furthermore, not many students are willing to take the time to learn how to cook, even though it's a useful skill, because it seems more immediately convenient to purchase fast food.<br>
      </p1>
      <br>
      <p2>
          Thus, the idea behind Flavor Finder was born; the mission was to create simple and affordable recipes based on what the users were interested in.
          We took several factors into consideration such as cultural preferences, affordability, and accessibility when curating our lists of recipes.

          Much like every design process, our application went through several revisions before eventually getting it correct.
